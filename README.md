Key Features:

User Input Validation: Ensures that all required fields are filled out correctly before submission to maintain data integrity.

Secure Password Handling: Implements password hashing to securely store user passwords in the database.

Database Integration: Utilizes PHP's database connectivity (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store registered user information securely.

Error Handling: Provides informative error messages for users in case of input validation failures or database connection issues.

Responsive Design: Ensures the form is accessible and visually appealing across different devices and screen sizes.

Technologies Used:

PHP: Core backend scripting language used for form processing, data validation, and database operations.

MySQL (or other database): Database management system used for storing and retrieving user registration data.

HTML/CSS: Provides the frontend structure and styling for the registration form.

Database Storage:
Validated user data is securely stored in the database after password hashing for security.
